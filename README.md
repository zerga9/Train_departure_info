# JavaScript Front-end Developer Test - Perm

## Problem description

We want to create a simple two "page" web application to display train services.
Our UX designer has created some mockups: 

1. On the first page there is a list of all departing services, like this:

![mockup](Farringdon_to_West_Hampstead_Thameslink___Services.png)


2. When user clicks/taps on a service, calling points are displayed:

![mockup](Farringdon_to_West_Hampstead_Thameslink___Live_Departures___Arrivals.png)

## Implementation details:

Create a React application with those two pages. 
Use the following data:

- List of departing services: wat-departures.json
- Click on first service: WAT-service-origin-W92931-2018-04-24.json
- Click on second service: WAT-service-origin-W92443-2018-04-24.json

These files include origins and destinations as codes, get your app working but just displaying these codes.
We have estimated the test to take a few hours, but feel free to use more time if you need it.
Feel free to make tradeoffs or simplify things.

**Nice to have:**

 - Is it a responsive app?
 - CSS-only solution (no images)
 - Routing

**We will pay attention to:**

 - Code quality
 - Readme: have you made any trade-offs? What do you
 - Naming conventions
 - Consistency
 - Styling
 - Tests quality
 - Commit history
